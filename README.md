# Loan Prediction System

This repository contains the implementation of a Loan Prediction System, a self-initiated project aimed at predicting the likelihood of loan approval based on various borrower attributes and loan features. The system leverages multiple machine learning models and an ensemble approach to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Project Overview

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the loan prediction dataset to understand the underlying patterns and relationships between borrower attributes and loan features.
- **Tools Used**: Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, enabling efficient examination of key variables such as credit history, income, loan amount, and employment status.
- **Insights**: The EDA provided valuable insights into the factors influencing loan approval, guiding the feature selection process for model training.

### 2. Model Training
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained three different machine learning classifiers to predict loan approval:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Utilized for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and robustness to outliers.
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Chosen for its ability to handle large datasets and its feature importance insights.
  - **Decision Tree Classifier**: Implemented for its interpretability and simplicity in visualizing decision-making processes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Each model was evaluated on the validation data, with performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall considered.

### 3. Ensemble Model Development
- **Ensemble Approach**: Developed an ensemble model that combines the predictions from the SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. The ensemble approach was designed to leverage the strengths of each individual model, resulting in improved overall performance.
